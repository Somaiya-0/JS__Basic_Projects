# JS Basic Projects

This repository contains two simple vanilla JavaScript projects:

- **Calculator** — A basic calculator app for simple arithmetic operations.
- **To_do_list** — A simple to-do list app to add, delete, and manage tasks.




## How to Run

### Option 1: Open directly in browser

1. Go to the `Calculator` or `To_do_list` folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file by double-clicking it or right-click → Open with your favorite web browser.

### Option 2: Run with a local server (optional, for better experience)

You can use a simple local server to avoid browser security issues:

- **Using VS Code Live Server**  
  Open the project folder in VS Code, then right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
